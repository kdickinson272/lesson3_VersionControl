            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is when there is one main repository for all the project files. If multiple people want to work on a project together from different computers using the same file, version control allows the team members to check files out, make the edits, then check them back into the one main repository. Using a version control system for your files allows your team to see who changed the files, when they were changed, what exactly was changed, and then creates one merged file of everyone’s edits. There are two different types of repositories for version control. One is a remote repository where the repository is on a remote server so that people on different computers can all access the shared files. The other type is a local repository. This repository is located on a local machine of the individual user.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a distributed version control system that is free to use. Git can handle anything from small to large projects and do so with efficiency and speed. Git outdoes other version control systems with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple work flows. Git thinks about data differently than other version control systems. Other vcs think about information they keep as a set of files and the changes made to the files over time. However, Git thinks of data as a set of snapshots of a file system. This makes it so that Git doesn’t save another file if nothing has changed from the previous version, it just links you to the previous file.

                <span class="text-muted">Benefits of Using Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a beneficial version control system to use because each user has a complete copy of the repository system on their own computer. Git also runs fast and efficiently and has no single point of failure where you could potentially lose your work. Git prevents accidental overwriting of files on the shared repository. Git stores data in a set of snapshots making it a very powerful vcs. Another benefit is that Git doesn’t really require information from another computer on your network. Most of Git’s operations only need local files and resources to operate. This makes getting information almost instantaneous because there is no getting it from other servers.

                <span class="text-muted">The Three States </span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git has three states that your project files can be in; committed, modified, and staged. When your files are in the committed state it means that the data is safely stored in your local database. When the file is committed it stores it as a snapshot permanently so you don’t lose it. The modified state is when you have changed a file but have not yet committed it to your database. When you are working on a file you are in the modified state. The last state, staged, is when you have marked a file that has been modified in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot.

                <span class="text-muted">Recording Repository Changes</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">To make sure you don’t lose anything important, you have to make sure you commit the changes you have made in your repository each time the project reaches a state you want to record. Your files in your working directory can be untracked or tracked. If a file is tracked it can be unmodified, modified, or staged. If a file is untracked it can be anything else, meaning any files in your working directory that are not in the staging state or in your last snapshot. As you begin to edit files, Git starts to see them as modified. Before you commit them you stage the files. Once you commit them the cycle repeats.
